# evangelion-android-quickbms-script
A QuickBMS script for Android game [Evangelion Slide Puzzle](https://archive.org/details/air.eva).

## Ownership
I did not make this script, I requested for this script to be made sometime in mid 2023. I did not manage to document who gave me this script before Zenhax shut down or even remember who made it, so I unfortunately can't credit the original author.

## Usage
This script is to be used with QuickBMS and the [Evangelion Slide Puzzle app](https://archive.org/details/air.eva) (EVAスライドパズル 使徒殲滅作戦). To use it, drag and drop the script to QuickBMS, then open an extracted .dat file from the app, then select an output folder.
